				<h2>Critical Thinking and Problem Solving</h2>
				<p>
					I use critical thinking each time I have a problem I need to solve. It's important to be able to problem solve since
				</p>
				<p>
					I needed to use a lot of problem solving in courses such as math and science. I remember having to do a lot of problem solving as I worked on a project for computer science where we would have to make a game. That was the biggest project I've competed so far and it took a lot of time. 
				</p>
				<p>
					To develop my critical thinking more, I could work on finding and solving more problems. Perhaps being part of such groups and clubs would help as well.
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id='innovation' class="tab">
				<h2>Innovation, Creativity and Entrepreneurship</h2>
				<p>
					Whenever I can I try to use my creativity to think of different ways to approach problems, usually in the ways that I do school projects. I also like to expand upon ideas if I have enough time to. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Back to my computer science project, I didn't want to make a super simple game like the examples my teacher showed. I wanted to challenge myself more and make something better, so I made a sort of platformer type game with a simple story. I had about two weeks to do it, so I didn't want to go overboard. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Doing more of those kinds of projects and looking into that kind of stuff would help in me developing this skill. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id='learning' class="tab">
				<h2>Self-directed Learning</h2>
				<p>
					I do what I can to learn anything I want to. It's very rewarding for me to learn something by myself and it allows me to go at my own pace, without any worry about deadlines and doing things I don't particulairly enjoy.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been teaching myself how to draw since I was very young. I later learned animation, 3D modeling and video editing. Relatively recently, I've also been learning how to code.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would also like to teach myself some more math and science. I used to use Khan Academy a bit to learn that kind of stuff and I would like to do more of it and develop the skill of self-directed learning. 
				</p> 
			</div>
			<div id='collaboration' class="tab">
				<h2>Collaboration</h2>
				<p>
					Working with people allows you to get different ideas, split the work and consult each other to solve problems easier. It can be really fun to work with people when everyone is on board. It's an important skill since we'll most likely be working with others in our future careers. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Typically, I work in groups for schools projects when I need to. I listen to what everyone has to say and try to put all our ideas together. Typically, these projects turn out great. I also like to work with my friends to complete personal projects sometimes for fun.
				</p>
				<p>
					I would really like to be a part of a team or more clubs at school to work more on my collaboration. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id='communication' class="tab">
				<h2>Communication</h2>
				<p>
					Communication skills are very important as we need to often interact with other people, online and in person. It's the key to expressing our ideas. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I like to talk to talk with my friends a lot. Both online and offline whenever we can. I also do my best to talk with my classmates in a classroom setting whenever it's allowed or encouraged. With that I'm practicing how I express myself. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Talking with more of my classmates would help me work on my communication skills more. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id='global-competence' class="tab">
				<h2>Global Competence</h2>
				<p>
					Understanding what's going on in the world and seeing the different points of view is important to do. I find it really interesting to see how other people's perspectives and lives differ from mine. Those types of discussions in schools always intruigued me.
				</p>
				<p>
					For example, in my art course we focused quite a bit on Indigenous people and their history. We learned a lot about their interactions with the settlers. 
				</p>
				<p>
					I want to look further into events happening in our country and the world to be more educated on such topics. I could try to look at the news more often and look into those events online. 
				</p>
			</div>
			<div id='tech-fluency' class="tab">
				<h2>Technological Fluency</h2>
				<p>
					I, like my peers, use technology a lot in my life, every day. I use it to communicate with others, for school, for entertainment and to learn.
				</p>
				<p>
					I've been learning to code as well. I learned python, back during winter and was able to practice a lot more during computer science this year. I also learned html and css back in April. Currently, I'm trying learning JavaScript, along with practicing the other languages I know.
				</p>
				<p>
					To work on my technological fluency I could try to learn more about computers and other technology of the sort.
